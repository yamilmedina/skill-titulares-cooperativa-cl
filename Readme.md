# Alexa Skill - Titulares Cooperativa 

This hosts the code for the experimental Alexa skill that reads news briefs from https://www.cooperativa.cl/

## Concept

KISS, just reading the rss, parsing the data and adding some pauses for the Text to Speech reader.

## Flow

The code is developed using `ask cli` so this is a mirror for the code pushed to CodeBuild of AWS Hosted Alexa Skill.
