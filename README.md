# Alexa Skill - Titulares Cooperativa 

Experimental Alexa skill that reads latest news briefs from https://www.cooperativa.cl/.

```
üó£Ô∏è "Alexa, pon noticias de Chile" ...
```


## Concept

KISS üôÉ Just reading the RSS provided by the website, parsing the data, plus some formatting and basic `ssml` to add some pauses for the Text to Speech reader.

## Flow

The code was developed using [`ask cli`](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/smapi/ask-cli-intro.html) so this is a mirror for the code pushed to `CodeCommit` from AWS Hosted [Alexa Hosted Skill](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/hosted-skills/build-a-skill-end-to-end-using-an-alexa-hosted-skill.html).
